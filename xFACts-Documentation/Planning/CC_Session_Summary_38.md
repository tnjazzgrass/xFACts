# CC Session Summary 38 — Client Portal migration

**Date:** 2026-06-06
**Page migrated:** Client Portal (`Tools.ClientPortal`, prefix `clp`, route `/client-portal`, section `tools`)
**Outcome:** All four files migrated and deployed. Final drift: CSS 0, JS 0, API 0, route 2 (transitional). Page verified functional and visually faithful via live walkthrough.

---

## 1. What shipped

Four files, full drop-in replacements, deployed as a set:

- `ClientPortal.ps1` (page route)
- `ClientPortal-API.ps1` (13 read-only GET endpoints, crs5_oltp)
- `client-portal.css`
- `client-portal.js`

The Client Portal is a four-view SPA (search / results / consumer detail / account detail) rendered as one route. It is a **deliberately light-themed content area** inside the dark CC shell — a single-page design choice, kept page-local per CSS spec §4.1 rather than mapped to dark chrome.

---

## 2. Final drift state

| File | Pre | Post |
|---|---|---|
| client-portal.css | 157 | **0** |
| client-portal.js | 107 | **0** |
| ClientPortal-API.ps1 | 16 | **0** (after the marker fix in §4) |
| ClientPortal.ps1 | 136 | **2** (transitional) |

The route's 2 are the known end-of-migration category, not file defects:
- **Import shim (2):** `MISPLACED_IMPORT` + `MISSING_RBAC_CHECK_PAGE` — the transitional `Import-Module xFACts-CCShared.psm1` as the first statement (so `Get-UserAccess` isn't literally first). Clears platform-wide when `Start-ControlCenter.ps1` loads CCShared at startup and the shim line is removed at end-of-migration.

CSS came in fully clean: the light-theme color literals did **not** flag, confirming `DRIFT_HEX_LITERAL` only fires where a shell token holds that exact value — the dark shell holds none of these light values. The Option-A approach (dimensional/timing values via shared tokens, light colors as literals) was the correct read.

---

## 3. Key decisions made this session

1. **Light-theme content stays page-local (`clp-` classes), not mapped to `cc-section`.** The portal's white cards are specific to one page; CSS §4.1 routes one-page variations to page-local classes rather than chrome. This preserves the deliberate light design and is conformant.
2. **CSS Option A** — dimensional/timing values mapped to shared tokens where the value matches (verified value-correct, no appearance change); light-theme colors as hex literals (no shared-token equivalent exists). This is the minimum-drift conformant form for a light page in a dark shell.
3. **Lookup-status readout moved into page content** (top of the search section), not the header center column. This *avoided* `cc-has-center` drift entirely rather than incurring it, and the indicator looked out of place in the header anyway. (Note: `cc-has-center` remains a known pending-populator-catch-up category for pages that *do* use the center column — Server Health — but Client Portal sidesteps it.)
4. **Tables flattened to class-per-cell.** The spec forbids bare-element (`th`/`td`/`thead`/`tr`) and descendant selectors outside the shell FOUNDATION. Tables now emit `clp-table`/`clp-thead`/`clp-th`/`clp-td`/`clp-row`/`clp-text-right`/`clp-totals-row`/`clp-totals-cell`. This couples CSS↔JS: the CSS defines the cell classes, the JS table-builders must emit them.
5. **Toggle = state-on-element.** The old `.toggle-switch.active .toggle-knob` descendant rule became two independent single-class rules; the JS adds `clp-active` to **both** the switch (track color) and the knob (slide position).
6. **Dropped the portal's `*` reset and `body` rule** — redundant with the shared FOUNDATION the page now loads. Only `overflow-x: hidden` genuinely disappears; tables handle their own overflow via `.clp-scroll-container { overflow-x: auto }`. No visual regression observed.
7. **Search interactions via dispatch tables** (`clp_keydownActions` Enter-to-search, `clp_inputActions` debounced client-filter) for platform consistency.

---

## 4. Post-deploy fixes (real drift / bugs caught after first deploy)

Three issues surfaced after the initial deploy; all fixed. Logged because they are recurring-pattern lessons:

- **API — 2× `MALFORMED_SUBSECTION_MARKER`** (the only non-zero API drift; I had predicted 0). The original `/search` endpoint had two inline divider comments `# ---- TWO-STEP PATH ----` and `# ---- SINGLE-QUERY PATH ----`. The box-banner removal pass stripped the `# ===` section banners but left these `# ----` sub-section dividers, which don't match the spec's strict §13.2 form. **Fix:** reshaped to `# -- Two-step path --` and `# -- Single-query path --`, each isolated by a blank line before and after. (Kept, not deleted — they mark two genuinely distinct search strategies.) **Lesson for remaining pages:** fold sub-section-marker normalization into the box-banner removal pass — scan for `# ----`-style dividers up front rather than discovering them at audit.
- **CSS — totals row greyed out** (cosmetic, caught in walkthrough). Flattening the tables split the original blanket `td { color: #1f2937 }` into `.clp-td`. The totals cells use `.clp-totals-cell`, which I'd left without a color, so the totals text washed out against the light band. **Fix:** added `color: #1f2937; font-weight: 600` to `.clp-totals-cell`. **Lesson:** when flattening a blanket element rule into per-class rules, every class that the element rule used to cover must inherit its properties — don't just create the "main" cell class and forget the variants.
- **Deploy — "Page boot function not found" banner on first load** (deploy-side, not a file defect). The route/API/CSS deployed but the JS was a stale pre-migration copy (still defined the old `Portal` IIFE, not `clp_init`). The bootloader injects `/js/<page>.js` with **no cache-busting query string**, so a stale page module is easy to get stuck on. **Lesson:** after deploying a migrated page, hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5); if the boot banner appears, first suspect a stale/partial JS deploy or browser cache of the un-versioned page module, not the file logic. (Confirmed clp_init globalizes correctly from a classic script even with top-level `const` present — verified via Node global-eval; the file was never the problem.)

---

## 5. Verification approach that worked

- **Node `--check`** on the JS for a real parse (no PowerShell runtime available; this catches syntax errors the structural scans miss). Worth doing on every JS file before declaring it ready — the structural/pattern scans do not parse.
- **Classic-script global-eval simulation** to confirm `<prefix>_init` actually lands on `window` (function declarations globalize even with top-level `const`/`let` present; `const`/`let` themselves do not attach to `window`, which is fine — dispatchers reference them lexically).
- **Cross-file integrity checks**: every emitted `data-action` value has a handler; every handler maps to an emitted action; every `clp-` CSS class the JS uses exists in the stylesheet; every DOM id the JS reads exists in the route. These caught nothing real this time but are the right gate.
- **Live walkthrough remains the only proof of behavior and appearance** — the totals-color bug was invisible to every populator and scan; only the eye caught it.

---

## 6. Zone progress

**Migrated (clean + transitional residual only), per S37 list plus this session:**
Backup, BIDATA Monitoring, Business Intelligence, Business Services, Client Relations, Index Maintenance, Replication Monitoring, DM Operations, JBoss Monitoring, **Client Portal** (new this session).

**Remaining: 2 pages.**
- **Platform Monitoring** (`ControlCenter.Platform`, prefix `plt`) — next session. Scoped below.
- **Admin** — last (meta-page; it manages the registry/version machinery the initiative itself uses).

After both, the end-of-migration cutover: `Start-ControlCenter.ps1` loads CCShared at startup, the per-route import shims are stripped (clears all the transitional `MISPLACED_IMPORT` + `MISSING_RBAC_CHECK_PAGE` rows platform-wide), and the legacy shared files (`engine-events.js`/`.css`, `xFACts-Helpers.psm1`) retire.

---

## 7. Platform Monitoring — scoping for next session

Scoped by reading the four current files this session (read-only; no build started). **Estimated drift baseline ~683 non-compliant rows** (per S35 zone snapshot) — middle of the pack, comparable to Batch Monitoring, lighter than Server Health (~1149) or Admin (~1502).

### 7.1 What the page is (corrected understanding)

Platform Monitoring is an **on-demand snapshot page**, NOT a live-polling / engine-card page. It measures the environmental impact of every xFACts process plus API/process metrics. Data is pulled **on page load, on manual refresh, and on tab-resume** — there is no polling schedule and there are no engine cards or registered orchestrator processes feeding it.

**Critical correction to first-glance read:** the JS contains engine-card *scaffolding* that is **vestigial / inert**, copied from a card-based template this page never actually used:
- `var ENGINE_PROCESSES = {}` — empty. No processes, no cards.
- `onEngineProcessCompleted(...)` — body is `// No event-driven sections on this page`. No-op.
- `onSessionExpired()` — empty `{ }`. No-op.
- `connectEngineEvents()` — called once in init, but connects to a stream the page doesn't use.

**Genuinely live behavior to PRESERVE:**
- `onPageResumed() { pageRefresh(); }` — re-pulls the snapshot when the tab regains focus. Real. → `PAGE LIFECYCLE HOOKS` banner.
- A `setInterval` that is a **midnight-rollover reload** (`if (new Date().toDateString() !== pageLoadDate) window.location.reload()` every 60s) — NOT data polling; it rolls the "today" window for a page left open overnight. Decide next session where this lives (likely a small init-registered timer; confirm spec placement).

**Decision for next session (spec-read, don't assume):** on a card-less page, does the spec want an empty `CONSTANTS: ENGINE PROCESSES` block present, or is its presence itself the drift signal to remove the scaffolding? Working hypothesis: **remove** the engine scaffolding entirely (no `plt_ENGINE_PROCESSES`, drop the `onEngineProcessCompleted` no-op) — this is *deletion*, not migration, and it reduces the lift. Confirm against the JS spec's engine-processes/hooks sections before acting.

### 7.2 Registry facts (CONFIRMED from Component_Registry)

Authoritative — confirmed from `Component_Registry` row (component_id 16):
- **Component:** `ControlCenter.Platform` (module **`ControlCenter`** — NOT ServerOps)
- **cc_prefix:** **`plt`**
- **Route:** `/platform-monitoring`
- **Section:** **`admin`** (NOT `controlcenter` — see access model below)
- **doc_cc_slug:** `platform`, doc_title "Platform Monitoring"

**Access model — nav-hidden, admin-gated, but chrome-wise ordinary.** Platform Monitoring is not a tile on the home page and does not appear as an entry in the nav; it is reached by going to Admin (itself reached only via the gear icon for site admins) and then a tile there. This is driven by a **nav-visibility flag in `Component_Registry` set to 0** — the same flag/value as **BDL Import** (a migrated page). The standard nav bar still **renders normally** on the page (via `Get-NavBarHtml`) to give links out to the other pages; the visibility flag only affects whether *this* page appears as a link in that nav, not how the page renders. So there is **NO special chrome handling** — the nav-registry helpers (`Get-NavBarHtml`, `Get-PageHeaderHtml`, `Get-PageBrowserTitle`) resolve exactly as they do for any other page; the dynamic nav in cc-shared filters the page out of the link set automatically.

**Consequences:**
- Body shell is **`cc-section-admin`** (from the registry; admin-gated). The H1/frame renders in the admin section accent — which maps to `--color-accent-platform` in cc-shared.css (admin pages use the platform accent). Confirm the exact present-vs-new frame color on the walkthrough.
- The route is a **normal route build, no asterisks** — the nav-hidden flag is handled entirely by the shared nav logic, not by anything this page's route does differently. **BDL Import is the conformant precedent** (migrated, same visibility-flag=0); it is the right reference if any chrome question arises — NOT Admin (Admin is unrefactored and not canonical).
- Component module (`ControlCenter`) and nav section (`admin`) are different axes: the component says who owns the code, the section says the access/accent family. Both come straight from the registry row.

**CRITICAL — prefix migration is part of the lift.** The existing files are on the WRONG prefix: the JS uses the `PM` module and `pm_`/`PM.` identifiers, the CSS uses `pm-` classes throughout, and the route uses `pm-` ids. The registered prefix is **`plt`**. So every identifier must be re-prefixed:
- CSS: every `.pm-*` class → `.plt-*` (touches essentially every selector — on top of the ~86-selector flatten)
- JS: every `PM.`/`pm_` identifier → `plt_`; the `PM` module name disappears with the IIFE unwind
- Route: every `pm-` id, class, and `data-action` value → `plt-`
- Cross-file: the CSS class rename and the JS class references must stay in lockstep — a class renamed in CSS but missed in the JS fires `JS_CSS_CLASS_UNRESOLVED`. The cross-file integrity check (§5) catches these, but it is volume.

This makes Platform's lift **larger than a clean-prefix page** — the pervasive `pm`→`plt` rename is mechanical but touches all four files and every cross-file reference. Budget for it.

**Chrome section:** body gets **`cc-section-admin`** (admin-gated, from the registry), `data-cc-page="platform-monitoring"`, `data-cc-prefix="plt"`. The H1/frame color follows the admin section accent (`--color-accent-platform`) — likely a visible frame-color change from today (same kind of intended shift seen on Client Portal's tools-accent). The page is nav-hidden via the `Component_Registry` visibility flag (=0, like BDL Import), but this is handled entirely by the shared nav logic — the route is an ordinary route build with no special chrome handling (§7.2).

(Earlier scoping incorrectly inferred `pm`/`ServerOps.PlatformMonitoring` from file contents — the registry overrides. Standing rule #1: verify from source, never infer from existing files. The files were on a wrong prefix, which is itself part of what the migration fixes.)

### 7.3 File-by-file lift estimate

Sizes (current): route 260 / API 520 / CSS 475 / JS 1015 lines.

- **API (`PlatformMonitoring-API.ps1`) — LIGHTEST.** 10 read-only GET endpoints. Only **1** inline single-line SQL literal (vs Client Portal's 26); **20** queries already in here-string form. Work is mostly: CBH header, single `ROUTE: API ENDPOINTS` banner, `Test-ActionEndpoint` guard as first statement per endpoint, box-banner removal, convert the 1 inline literal. **Watch:** the em-dash/BOM byte issues seen in Client Portal's API — check for them here too.

- **Route (`PlatformMonitoring.ps1`) — MODERATE.** Single page route, `/platform-monitoring`. Currently loads `engine-events.css` (retire — folded into cc-shared), Chart.js from **CDN** (see 7.4), and has an **inline `<script>` block** (~line 198) that must move into the JS module. Reshell chrome to `cc-*` (header-bar/refresh-info/banners), body `cc-section-admin` + `data-cc-page="platform-monitoring"` + `data-cc-prefix="plt"`, lift the import shim verbatim, single `cc-shared.js` tag last (after vendored Chart.js tags). `onclick` handlers (6) → `data-action-*` dispatch with `plt-` values. Ordinary route build — the nav-hidden flag is handled by shared nav logic, no special chrome handling (§7.2).

- **CSS (`platform-monitoring.css`) — HEAVIEST LIFT.** No `:root`, no custom properties already (good — no token-extraction war; dark-palette page, 178 hex literals that should mostly map to existing shell tokens). Two compounding jobs: **(a) selector flattening** — ~86 forbidden selectors (**55 descendant**, **22 element**, 3 attribute, 5 group, 1 depth-3, 1 universal, plus 6 `!important` to remove); **(b) prefix rename** `pm-` → `plt-` on every class. Mostly `.pm-x .pm-y` descendant rules → flattened class-per-element `.plt-*`, same pattern as Client Portal's tables but at ~5× the volume.

- **JS (`platform-monitoring.js`) — MODERATE-HEAVY.** ~1015 lines, `PM = (function(){...})()` revealing-module IIFE to unwind to top-level **`plt_`** functions (~48 functions, 138 `var`, 0 `let`, 0 `window.` assignments — clean starting point). The `PM` module name disappears with the unwind; every `PM.`/`pm_` identifier becomes `plt_`. Only 6 `onclick` → small dispatch tables. **Has Chart.js charting** (CPU-trend-over-time) to preserve. **Has the vestigial engine scaffolding to delete** (see 7.1). Inline route `<script>` block to absorb. Migrate `esc`→`cc_escapeHtml`, raw fetch→`cc_engineFetch`, `alert()`→`cc_showAlert` as usual.

### 7.4 Chart.js — vendored, not CDN (spec-encoded pattern)

The page pulls Chart.js from a CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`). This is drift. The fix is a **known, spec-encoded pattern** (CC_HTML_Spec §3.2.2, closed vendored-library set) — the Replication Monitoring migration drove the web→local move and the vendored files are already committed under `/public/js/` and already anchored by the populator. No new files to create.

- CDN `<script>` → `<script src="/js/chart.min.js"></script>` (local, no `defer`/`async`/`type`).
- If the CPU-trend chart uses a time-scale axis (almost certainly), also add `<script src="/js/chartjs-adapter-date-fns.min.js"></script>`.
- Both vendored tags go in `<body>`, after page content, **immediately before** the mandatory `<script src="/js/cc-shared.js"></script>` (which is always last). No other `<script>` tags permitted.
- The charting **JS** (Chart construction/config) moves from the inline route `<script>` block into `platform-monitoring.js`.

### 7.5 Estimated effort

Comparable in total to Client Portal, with a different distribution: **API much lighter**, **CSS notably heavier** (the ~86-selector flatten is the long pole), JS moderate (IIFE unwind + charting preserve + scaffolding delete). The engine-scaffolding removal *reduces* work relative to a true card page like JBoss. Realistic single-session page if the CSS flatten goes smoothly; the CSS is where to budget the time.

## 8. Session boot sequence (next session)

1. Read the instructions, then this summary (CC_Session_Summary_38).
2. `project_knowledge_search` for the active anchor docs (this summary, Development Guidelines, Backlog, Platform Registry) to confirm Project Knowledge state; `web_fetch` cache-busted manifest for anything else.
3. Platform Monitoring registry facts are **confirmed** (§7.2): `ControlCenter.Platform`, prefix **`plt`**, route `/platform-monitoring`, section **`admin`**, nav-hidden via the `Component_Registry` visibility flag (=0, like BDL Import). The existing files are on the wrong prefix (`pm`); the `pm`→`plt` rename across all four files is part of the migration (§7.2). Body is `cc-section-admin`. The route is an ordinary build — the nav-hidden flag is handled by shared nav logic, no special chrome handling. If any chrome question arises, BDL Import is the conformant precedent (NOT unrefactored Admin).
4. Request the four current files.
5. Build order: route → API → CSS → JS. Lift the CCShared import shim verbatim from a deployed route (do not reconstruct).
6. Resolve the engine-scaffolding question (§7.1) by reading the JS spec's engine-processes/hooks sections **before** building the JS.
7. Verify each file with the gates from §5 (Node `--check` on JS; classic-script global-eval for init; cross-file integrity; live walkthrough for behavior/appearance).

---

## 9. Carried backlog (unchanged from S37 unless noted)

- Sub-section-marker normalization folded into box-banner removal pass (new this session — §4).
- `FORBIDDEN_FUNCTION_IN_API_ROUTE` populator coverage-gap investigation (from S31).
- DmOps launch/abort `RBAC_ActionRegistry` rows; DmOps Archive launch testing (Shell Purge confirmed).
- Retention strategy for snapshot tables (no retention anywhere today).
- DBCC disk-alert suppression during CHECKDB runs (medium).
- B2B module: `B2B_Roadmap.md` is the authoritative entry point; investigation-first stance.
- End-of-migration cutover (after Platform + Admin): startup CCShared load, strip import shims, retire `engine-events.*` and `xFACts-Helpers.psm1`.
